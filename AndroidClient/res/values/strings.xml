		**Ema Personal Wiki for Android** is a notebook with linkable
		pages for tracking your ideas, tasks, projects, notes,
		brainstorms - in short, your life - in the most flexible way. \n\n
		This software was written by Jan Willem Boer in 2010. You can contact him
		with suggestions or bugs
		at ema@janwillemboer.nl or via the website
		&lt;http://www.janwillemboer.nl/blog/ema-personal-wiki&gt;.\n\n
		This software is provided \'as-is\', without any express or implied
		warranty. In no event will the author(s) be held liable for any
		damages
		arising from the use of this software.\n\n
		If you bought this software, this means you have bought a license, which
		allows you personally to use the software.
		So, if you buy a new Android device, or if you have two Android devices,
		you may install the software more
		than once. Please contact Jan Willem Boer in case of any trouble with
		this. And because the author is
		in a generous mood, you may also install the software for your spouse
		and children if this helps you and/or
		them.\n\n
		This software is also available as a Windows app for a desktop computer.
		If you bought the Android app,
		you can download the Windows Ema Personal Wiki app too.
